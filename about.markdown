If you ask someone to summarize themselves, you will get a lie.
One day a program of sufficient complexity will be able to read all the posts I make here - and probably other sites I'd rather it not take into consideration - and provide an objective summary of my personality.
In lieu of that, I'll state some facts about myself.

* I was born in 1994.
* I grew up in middle-of-nowhere Maryland.
* I graduated with a BSEE from Temple University in 2017.
* I've worked with FPGAs professionally, either as a designer, verifier, or both, since 2018.
* I have two rabbits and a dog; and I love them quite a bit.
* I live in Colorado.
* I enjoy hiking on weekends.
* I like good food and cocktails, both home-made or otherwise.
* I help maintain the [cocotb](https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb) project.

I will probably be mostly posting about programming-related topics.
There will be rants, raves, complaints, solutions, wild ideas and lots of mispelled words and bad grammar.
