title: Zelda, the Rat
---

Zelda passed away this morning.
Passing in much the same way as his brother, Link.
He loved being comfty.
He was always up for a treat, and rarely up otherwise.
He would root around blankets and pillows to find the perfect place where he could also stare at me or nap with his brother.
He was the last of the three brothers.
He was 2 years and 1 month old.
