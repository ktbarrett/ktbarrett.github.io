My boy, Link, passed away this morning.
He passed peacefully laying with his brother Zelda, from an infection he was too old to fight.
He was always the first to greet you when you entered the room.
He would climb up anything and was eager to explore.
He loved Cheerios, shoulder rides, and his brother.
He was 2 years old.
