# As It Stands, Technocratic Feudalism (Or Is It?)

## Feudalism as a Convenient Analogy

## The Knights in Shining Black Armor

## Where are the Kings?

# Out of Anarchy, Government

## The Right was Right (duh)

# *And That's a Good Thing!*

## The Ends Do Justify the Means

# Reflecting And Improving

## Improving Caste Placement via Social Contract
