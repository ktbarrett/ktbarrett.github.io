title: Reflecting on the Goverance Model of FOSS

This is going to be a long-ass, well-researched, extremely-hyphenated post, so give me a couple minutes.

# As It Stands, Technocratic Feudalism (Or Is It?)

Feudalism is a convenient, but not exactly correct, analogy.
"land" = projects.

## The Peasants

Users and minor contributors.
Don't own land.
No political power.
Easily abused by power ("wontfix").

## The Knights in Shining Black Armor

Maintainers and core contributors.
Don't own "land", but contibute to the good of their land and as a result have some say.

## The Landlords

"Benevolent Dictators For Life"
Own "land".

## The Clergymen

Perenial "thinkers".
Convention speakers and YouTubers.
May own no "land".
Highly influential over landlords.

## Where are the Kings?

FOSS is very distributed, on purpose.
At best there are "minor" kings who end up having a say, indirectly over land they do not directly own by their being the center of a framework (think Guido).

# Out of Anarchy, Government

## The Right was Right (duh)

Right-anarchists were correct.
Heirarchy is pervasive.
People will self-organize around these hierarchies naturally over time.

## Why No Kings?

No existing established centralized power.
Berkley nor MIT wanted it.
GNU nor FSF wanted it.
ESR and "The Unix Philosophy" proselytized against it.
No one else had anywhere near the power at the beginning.
Inifinte land to settle.
Little threat of violence possible, no "protection" needed.

# *And That's a Good Thing!*

The ends do justify the means.
The current neo-feudalistic system is not *evil*.
Democracy isn't required or absolute.
The system was created *on purpose* to meet the goals the system was created for: high quality software.

# Reflecting And Improving

## [Feature Request] Improving Caste Placement

Implement a group that marries "climbers" to projects that need help based on availability and fit.
Political churn prevents kingship.
