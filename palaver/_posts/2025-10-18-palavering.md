I started up this section of the blog for small daily posts which can be kept separate from the long-form regular blog posts that deserve editing and thought.
This section is for drunken rambling and sharing fragments of ideas and experiences.
It's better to spew and share any and all random thoughts and experiences than live a life unsaid and wonder what exactly you did with your time once its all passed.
Now I'll have a long record of pointless crap I can proudly point to, "See I was alive!"

This section is titled after how Bohumil Hrabal described his style of writing.
Read "Too Loud A Solitude" if you haven't.
