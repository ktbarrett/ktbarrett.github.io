    "My House Was Surrounded By Cornfields and I Was Depressed"
---

So I live in Denver now, which is basically the Midwest if you ask the Californians that keep move here for some fucking reason.
I was joking around with an old friend from Alabama about Midwest Emo songs being titled either extremely specific and nonsensical full-ass sentences,
e.g. "We Made Love On The Sheets I Rubbed My Cheetos-Stained Fingers On" or just single words which are people's names like "Rudy" or "Carissa."
This of course reminded me of [Carissa - Sun Kill Moon](https://youtu.be/BSaUXsaBnI8?si=46pVi0hyv46f7gEQ).

This friend of course had to look through Mark's disco and found the song "This Is My First Day and I'm Indian and I Work At a Gas Station" which is ***THE*** Midwest-est song title of all time.

Anyways, this all went down at my local bar which was hosting a Karaoke night after the Broncos game.
It was a small gathering mostly inhabited by the servers/bartenders who had some interest in belting ABBA at the top of their lungs on company time (no shame).
I was asked if I wanted to sing and I declined because "I don't know anything but sad songs."
I don't think they'd love to hear [The Anvil Will Fall by Harvey Milk](https://youtu.be/05njPSdMRzE?si=yWS65HwlJdfoJ4FR)
or [Tango Till They're Sore by Tom Waits](https://youtu.be/FSZxJpf1IHI?si=P64aTx-3OPKDkfah).
