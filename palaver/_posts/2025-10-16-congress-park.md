I just moved to Congress Park in Denver from Broomfield (Boulder-ish) recently.
The people here are quite a bit nicer.

I randomly bumped into someone when picking up my keys for the new place and told her I was moving in and we petted each other's dogs.
She sent me a welcome letter and invited me to a community clean-up event on Sunday.
I never got anything like that at my last place; they would often just ignore you if you gave them a friendly "hi."

Then yesterday went to the neighborhood bar and talked to the bartenders a bit and got free tickets to the concert going on down the street.
I had no idea who was playing, it was sold to me as "folk," and why not? I didn't have anything better to do...
But Willi Carlisle is the kind of folk people are talking about when they say "American Folk Music,"
it's bluegrass and old country mixed with old union songs. Think Woody Guthrie or Pete Seeger.
It's not really my thing, more my dad's thing, but it was a cool experience never the less.
