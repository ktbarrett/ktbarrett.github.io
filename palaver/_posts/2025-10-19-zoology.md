It's very weird to me that people are depicted as having dreams when they were younger that is somehow an indication of who they "truly" are.
There's some Socratic stink there.
And some of the American Progressive obsession with innocence, Tabula Rasa, etc.

You know what I wanted to be when I was younger?
Well I was obsessed with dinosaurs like every white boy.
I was actually the only white boy I knew who was obsessed with them, but IYKYK.
So I wanted to be a student of the dinosaur, but not the extinction dinosaur, not the archeologist,
but the study of the alive-again dinosaur, a zoologist.

That'd still be cool.
Eh... maybe next year.
