title: Rural Industrial Noise - Field Recordings on Lawn Care
---

Call me a freak, but I enjoy noise music.

Recently, while enjoying a drink in my backyard, my neighbor had a company come in to mow their lawn.
While I closed my eyes, soaked up the sun during this rather mild and enjoyable summmer we are having (I'm one happy fucking camper);
I listened.
The low-mid rumble and high-pitching shearing of the grass of the mower;
occasionally whinning with a slight tremble of instability during tight turns.
The weed whacker giving an interrupted mid-pitch whinning, beating menancingly, inconsistently, against the fence or the house;
like it was being push through a compression filter.
Totally a-melodic;
almost robotic;
but still human in delivery;
just like the professionals that delivered the service.
It was an experience.
It was inspiring;
at least enough to write this post;
in part, thanks to the Laphroaig swimming in my head (at least that's what it feels like :relieved:).

Either way, I should capture, to the best of my abilities this sound the next time they come around.

Too many field recordings are urban.
It's not something I can understand, or appreciate, being a perenial suburban or ruralite.
Many more, naively, are *literal field recordings*.
While this can be pleasant (Завмирання - Drudkh), nature has no emotion.
Just as in that song, meaning is overlaid onto the recording with melody, and the recording itself seemingly manipulated for effect.
So to enjoy field recordings, *as I figure they were meant to be*;
the partially human, partially not, sounds of lawn care fit the bill.
